<h3> 1. Camera grid </h3>

<p2>
  The Camera Grid divides the frame into thirds vertically and horisontally(9 squares). This relates to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds" title="The rule of thirds" target="_blank">The rule of thirds</a> which helps with creating balanced composition and take more aesthetically pleasing photos.The rule of thirds can be applied when taking photos without a grid also, but it makes it easier to see if everything is placed at the proper intersection.

    <img src="Images/filters.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt=""/>
    <p2>People have started to like old looking pictures more than the ones that we can see all over the internet these days, and this is why filters are starting to be used more than ever. They help you change your pictures' aspect and and give a more vintage and unique vibe.  </p2>
  <h3>5. HDR</h3>
   <img src="Images/HDR.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt=""/>
   <p2>HDR stands for High Dynamic Range and is supposed to give your pictures a better contrast, better brightness level and a better colour mix. Using this will make your pictures look more like real life and less blurry or pale.  </p2>

  <div id="right_column">
  <h3>2. Focus</h3>
  <img src="Images/iPhone-7-Plus-Portrait-Mode-ios-10.1-public-beta.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt=""/>
  <p2>Focus helps with drawing attention to the main subject of the picture. If your photo is completely out of focus, it would be too blurry and you won't be able to see any details, which is important when taking pictures. </p2>
  <p style="font-size:15px;"> Make sure you tap on the screen on something close to the camera before you take a photo, so the focus will be on it. If you want the focus to be on the background, just tap a background object and what is placed in the frod will become blurry. </p>
  <h3>4."Find light. No flash"</h3>
  <img src="Images/no light.png" width="400" height="200" alt=""/>
  <p2>If you want to take more artistic pictures, flash is not going to help you. The best thing to do is to find a light source, go near it to make sure that the light is on the picture's subject, followed by tapping on it, to set exposure and then you are ready to take the picture. </p2>
